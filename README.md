About this project
===
細胞分裂(Cell Division) is a game that both player and enemies(computers) are cells that can chase or eat each other while in the gameplay. 
Player can eat the red dots on the map to gain cell mass and avoid being eaten by enemies, and player needs to find the way out to win in the game.

Motivation
===
Agar.io is a well known massive multiplayer online action game created by Brazilian developer Matheus Valadares in 2015. 
Players control one or more circular cells in a map representing a Petri dish. 
The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating cells and player cells smaller than the player's cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cells. 
Each player starts with one cell, but players can split a cell into two once it reaches a sufficient mass, allowing them to control multiple cells. 

Detail of the game
